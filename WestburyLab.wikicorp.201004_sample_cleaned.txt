Anarchism Anarchism political philosophy considers state undesirable unnecessary harmful instead promotes stateless society anarchy It seeks diminish even abolish authority conduct human relations Anarchists may widely disagree additional criteria required anarchism The Oxford Companion Philosophy says single defining position anarchists hold considered anarchists best share certain family

Aristotle Aristotle Aristotls BC BC Greek philosopher student Plato teacher Alexander Great His writings cover many subjects including physics metaphysics poetry theater music logic rhetoric politics government ethics biology zoology Together Plato Socrates Platos teacher Aristotle one important founding figures Western philosophy Aristotles writings constitute first creating comprehensive system Western philosophy encompassing morality aesthetics logic science politics metaphysics Aristotles views physical sciences profoundly shaped medieval scholarship influence extended well Renaissance although ultimately replaced Newtonian physics In biological sciences observations confirmed accurate nineteenth century His works contain earliest known formal study logic incorporated late nineteenth century modern formal logic In metaphysics Aristotelianism profound influence philosophical theological thinking Islamic Jewish traditions Middle Ages continues influence Christian theology especially Eastern Orthodox theology scholastic tradition Catholic Church His ethics though always influential gained renewed interest modern advent virtue ethics All aspects Aristotles philosophy continue object active academic study today Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises dialogues Cicero described literary style river gold thought majority writings lost onethird original works survived Despite farreaching appeal Aristotles works traditionally enjoyed today modern scholarship questions substantial portion Aristotelian corpus authentically Aristotles Life Aristotle born Stageira Chalcidice BC east modernday Thessaloniki His father Nicomachus personal physician King Amyntas Macedon Aristotle trained educated member aristocracy At age eighteen went Athens continue education Platos Academy Aristotle remained academy nearly twenty years leaving Platos death BC He traveled Xenocrates court friend Hermias Atarneus Asia Minor While Asia Aristotle traveled Theophrastus island Lesbos together researched botany zoology island Aristotle married Hermiass adoptive daughter niece Pythias She bore daughter named Pythias Soon Hermias death Aristotle invited Philip II Macedon become tutor son Alexander Great BC Aristotle appointed head royal academy Macedon During time gave lessons Alexander also two future kings Ptolemy Cassander In Politics Aristotle states one thing could justify monarchy virtue king family greater virtue rest citizens put together Tactfully included young prince father category Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest attitude towards Persia unabashedly ethnocentric In one famous example counsels Alexander leader Greeks despot barbarians look former friends relatives deal latter beasts plants By BC returned Athens establishing school known Lyceum Aristotle conducted courses school next twelve years While Athens wife Pythias died Aristotle became involved Herpyllis Stageira bore son named father Nicomachus According Suda also eromenos Palaephatus Abydus It period Athens BC Aristotle believed composed many works Aristotle wrote many dialogues fragments survived The works survived treatise form part intended widespread publication generally thought lecture aids students His important treatises include Physics Metaphysics Nicomachean Ethics Politics De Anima On Soul Poetics Aristotle studied almost every subject possible time made significant contributions In physical science Aristotle studied anatomy astronomy embryology geography geology meteorology physics zoology In philosophy wrote aesthetics ethics government metaphysics politics economics psychology rhetoric theology He also studied education foreign customs literature poetry His combined works constitute virtual encyclopedia Greek knowledge It suggested Aristotle probably last person know everything known time Near end Alexanders life Alexander began suspect plots threatened Aristotle letters Aristotle made secret contempt Alexanders pretense divinity king executed Aristotles grandnephew Callisthenes traitor A widespread tradition antiquity suspected Aristotle playing role Alexanders death little evidence Upon Alexanders death antiMacedonian sentiment Athens flared Eurymedon hierophant denounced Aristotle holding gods honor Aristotle fled city mothers family estate Chalcis explaining I allow Athenians sin twice philosophy reference Athenss prior trial execution Socrates However died Euboea natural causes within year BC Aristotle named chief executor student Antipater left asked buried next wife Logic With Prior Analytics Aristotle credited earliest study formal logic conception dominant form Western logic th century advances mathematical logic Kant stated Critique Pure Reason Aristotles theory logic completely accounted core deductive inference History Aristotle says subject reasoning nothing else earlier date speak However Plato reports syntax devised Prodicus Ceos concerned correct use words Logic seems emerged dialectics earlier philosophers made frequent use concepts like reductio ad absurdum discussions never truly understood logical implications Even Plato difficulties logic although reasonable conception deducting system could never actually construct one relied instead dialectic Plato believed deduction would simply follow premises hence focused maintaining solid premises conclusion would logically follow Consequently Plato realized method obtaining conclusions would beneficial He never succeeded devising method best attempt published book Sophist introduced division method Analytics Organon The order books teachings composed certain list derived analysis Aristotles writings It goes basics analysis simple terms Categories analysis propositions elementary relations On Interpretation study complex forms namely syllogisms Analytics dialectics Topics Sophistical Refutations The first three treatises form core logical theory stricto sensu grammar language logic correctness rules reasoning There one volume Aristotles concerning logic found Organon namely fourth book Metaphysics Aristotles scientific method Like teacher Plato Aristotles philosophy aims universal Aristotle however found universal particular things called essence things Plato finds universal exists apart particular things related prototype exemplar For Aristotle therefore philosophic method implies ascent study particular phenomena knowledge essences Plato philosophic method means descent knowledge universal Forms ideas contemplation particular imitations For Aristotle form still refers unconditional basis phenomena instantiated particular substance see Universals particulars In certain sense Aristotles method inductive deductive Platos essentially deductive priori principles In Aristotles terminology natural philosophy branch philosophy examining phenomena natural world includes fields would regarded today physics biology natural sciences In modern times scope philosophy become limited generic abstract inquiries ethics metaphysics logic plays major role Todays philosophy tends exclude empirical study natural world means scientific method In contrast Aristotles philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually facets intellectual inquiry In larger sense word Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive reasoning also would describe science Note however use term science carries different meaning covered term scientific method For Aristotle science dianoia either practical poetical theoretical Metaphysics b By practical science means ethics politics poetical science means study poetry fine arts theoretical science means physics mathematics metaphysics If logic analytics regarded study preliminary philosophy divisions Aristotelian philosophy would consist Logic Theoretical Philosophy including Metaphysics Physics Mathematics Practical Philosophy Poetical Philosophy In period two stays Athens times Academy Lyceum Aristotle conducted scientific thinking research renowned today In fact Aristotles life devoted study objects natural science Aristotles metaphysics contains observations nature numbers made original contributions mathematics He however perform original research natural sciences eg botany zoology physics astronomy chemistry meteorology several sciences Aristotles writings science largely qualitative opposed quantitative Beginning sixteenth century scientists began applying mathematics physical sciences Aristotles work area deemed hopelessly inadequate His failings largely due absence concepts like mass velocity force temperature He conception speed temperature quantitative understanding partly due absence basic experimental devices like clocks thermometers His writings provide account many scientific observations mixture precocious accuracy curious errors For example History Animals claimed human males teeth females Generation Animals said female deformed male In similar vein John Philoponus later Galileo showed simple experiments Aristotles theory heavier object falls faster lighter object incorrect On hand Aristotle refuted Democrituss claim Milky Way made stars shaded earth suns rays pointing correctly even reasoning bound dismissed long time given current astronomical demonstrations size sun greater earth distance stars earth many times greater sun thenthe sun shines stars earth screens none In places Aristotle goes far deriving laws universe simple observation overstretched reason Todays scientific method assumes thinking without sufficient facts ineffective discerning validity ones hypothesis requires far rigorous experimentation Aristotle used support laws Aristotle also scientific blind spots He posited geocentric cosmology may discern selections Metaphysics widely accepted From rd century dominant view held Earth center universe geocentrism Since perhaps philosopher respected European thinkers Renaissance thinkers often took Aristotles erroneous positions given held back science epoch However Aristotles scientific shortcomings mislead one forgetting great advances many scientific fields For instance founded logic formal science created foundations biology superseded two millennia Moreover introduced fundamental notion nature composed things change studying changes provide useful knowledge underlying constants The five elements Each four earthly elements natural place earth centre universe water air fire When natural place natural motion requiring external cause towards place bodies sink water air bubbles rise rain falls flame rises air The heavenly element perpetual circular motion Causality The Four Causes Additionally things causes one another causing reciprocally hard work causes fitness vice versa although way function one beginning change goal Thus Aristotle first suggested reciprocal circular causality relation mutual dependence influence cause upon effect Moreover Aristotle indicated thing cause contrary effects presence absence may result different outcomes Simply goal purpose brings event necessarily mental goal Taking two dominos requires someone intentionally knock dominos cannot fall Aristotle marked two modes causation proper prior causation accidental chance causation All causes proper incidental spoken potential actual particular generic The language refers effects causes generic effects assigned generic causes particular effects particular causes operating causes actual effects Essentially causality suggest temporal relation cause effect All investigations causality consist imposing favorite hierarchies order causes final efficient material formal Thomas Aquinas restricting causality material efficient causes efficient causality deterministic chance regular sequences correlations natural phenomena natural sciences describing things happen instead explaining whys wherefores Optics Aristotle held accurate theories optical concepts philosophers day The earliest known written evidence camera obscura found Aristotles documentation device BC Problemata Aristotles apparatus contained dark chamber single small hole aperture allow sunlight enter Aristotle used device make observations sun noted matter shape hole sun would still correctly displayed round object In modern cameras analogous diaphragm Aristotle also made observation distance tiny hole surface image increased image amplified Chance spontaneity Spontaneity chance causes effects Chance incidental cause lies realm accidental things It spontaneous note spontaneous come chance For better understanding Aristotles conception chance might better think coincidence Something takes place chance person sets intent one thing take place result another thing intended taking place For example A person seeks donations That person may find another person willing donate substantial sum However person seeking donations met person donating purpose collecting donations purpose Aristotle would call collecting donation particular donator result chance It must unusual something happens chance In words something happens time cannot say chance There also specific kind chance Aristotle names luck apply human beings since sphere moral actions According Aristotle luck must involve choice thus deliberation humans capable deliberation choice What capable action cannot anything chance Metaphysics Aristotle defines metaphysics knowledge immaterial highest degree abstraction He refers metaphysics first philosophy well theologic science Substance potentiality actuality Aristotle examines concept substance essence ousia Metaphysics Book VII concludes particular substance combination matter form As proceeds book VIII concludes matter substance substratum stuff composed eg matter house bricks stones timbers etc whatever constitutes potential house While form substance actual house namely covering bodies chattels differentia see also predicables The formula gives components account matter formula gives differentia account form With regard change kinesis causes defines Physics On Generation Corruption ba distinguishes coming growth diminution change quantity locomotion change space alteration change quality The coming change nothing persists resultant property In particular change introduces concept potentiality dynamis actuality entelecheia association matter form Referring potentiality thing capable acted upon prevented something else For example seed plant soil potentially dynamei plant prevented something become plant Potentially beings either act poiein acted upon paschein either innate learned For example eyes possess potentiality sight innate acted upon capability playing flute possessed learning exercise acting Actuality fulfillment end potentiality Because end telos principle every change sake end exists potentiality therefore actuality end Referring previous example could say actuality seed plant becomes plant For sake thing principle becoming sake end actuality end sake potentiality acquired For animals see order may sight sight may see In conclusion matter house potentiality form actuality The formal cause aitia change potential actual house reason logos house builder final cause end namely house Then Aristotle proceeds concludes actuality prior potentiality formula time substantiality With definition particular substance ie matter form Aristotle tries solve problem unity beings eg makes man one Since according Plato two Ideas animal biped man unity However according Aristotle potential matter actual one form one thing Universals particulars Aristotles predecessor Plato argued things universal form could either property relation things When look apple example see apple also analyze form apple In distinction particular apple universal form apple Moreover place apple next book speak book apple next Plato argued universal forms part particular things For example possible particular good existence good still proper universal form Bertrand Russell contemporary philosopher agreed Plato existence uninstantiated universals Aristotle disagreed Plato point arguing universals instantiated Aristotle argued universals unattached existing things According Aristotle universal exists either particular relation must must currently must future something universal predicated Consequently according Aristotle case universal predicated object exists period time exist In addition Aristotle disagreed Plato location universals As Plato spoke world forms location universal forms subsist Aristotle maintained universals exist within thing universal predicated So according Aristotle form apple exists within apple rather world forms Biology medicine In Aristotelian science especially biology things saw stood test time better retelling reports others contain error superstition He dissected animals humans ideas human body works almost entirely superseded Empirical research program Aristotle earliest natural historian whose work survived detail Aristotle certainly research natural history Lesbos surrounding seas neighbouring areas The works reflect research History Animals Generation Animals Parts Animals contain observations interpretations along sundry myths mistakes The striking passages sealife visible observation Lesbos available catches fishermen His observations catfish electric fish Torpedo anglerfish detailed writing cephalopods namely Octopus Sepia cuttlefish paper nautilus Argonauta argo His description hectocotyl arm two thousand years ahead time widely disbelieved rediscovery nineteenth century He separated aquatic mammals fish knew sharks rays part group called Selach selachians Another good example methods comes Generation Animals Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs intervals observe visible organs generated He gave accurate descriptions ruminants fourchambered forestomachs ovoviviparous embryological development hound shark Mustelus mustelus Classification living things Aristotles classification living things contains elements still existed nineteenth century What modern zoologist would call vertebrates invertebrates Aristotle called animals blood animals without blood know complex invertebrates make use haemoglobin different kind vertebrates Animals blood divided livebearing humans mammals eggbearing birds fish Invertebrates animals without blood insects crustacea divided nonshelled cephalopods shelled testacea molluscs In respects incomplete classification better Linnaeus crowded invertebrata together two groups Insecta Vermes worms For Charles Singer Nothing remarkable Aristotles efforts exhibit relationships living things scala naturae Aristotles History Animals classified organisms relation hierarchical Ladder Life scala naturae placing according complexity structure function higher organisms showed greater vitality ability move Aristotle believed intellectual purposes ie formal causes guided natural processes Such teleological view gave Aristotle cause justify observed data expression formal design Noting animal time tusks horns singlehooved animal two horns I never seen Aristotle suggested Nature giving animal horns tusks staving vanity giving creatures faculties degree necessary Noting ruminants multiple stomachs weak teeth supposed first compensate latter Nature trying preserve type balance In similar fashion Aristotle believed creatures arranged graded scale perfection rising plants man scala naturae Great Chain Being His system eleven grades arranged according degree infected potentiality expressed form birth The highest animals laid warm wet creatures alive lowest bore cold dry thick eggs Aristotle also held level creatures perfection reflected form preordained form Ideas like ideas souls regarded science modern times He placed emphasis types soul organism possessed asserting plants possess vegetative soul responsible reproduction growth animals vegetative sensitive soul responsible mobility sensation humans vegetative sensitive rational soul capable thought reflection Aristotle contrast earlier philosophers accordance Egyptians placed rational soul heart rather brain Notable Aristotles division sensation thought generally went previous philosophers exception Alcmaeon Successor Theophrastus Aristotles successor Lyceum Theophrastus wrote series books botanythe History Plantswhich survived important contribution antiquity botany even Middle Ages Many Theophrastus names survive modern times carpos fruit pericarpion seed vessel Rather focus formal causes Aristotle Theophrastus suggested mechanistic scheme drawing analogies natural artificial processes relying Aristotles concept efficient cause Theophrastus also recognized role sex reproduction higher plants though last discovery lost later ages Influence Hellenistic medicine After Theophrastus Lyceum failed produce original work Though interest Aristotles ideas survived generally taken unquestioningly It age Alexandria Ptolemies advances biology found The first medical teacher Alexandria Herophilus Chalcedon corrected Aristotle placing intelligence brain connected nervous system motion sensation Herophilus also distinguished veins arteries noting latter pulse former Though ancient atomists Lucretius challenged teleological viewpoint Aristotelian ideas life teleology rise Christianity natural theology would remain central biological thought essentially th th centuries Ernst Mayr claimed nothing real consequence biology Lucretius Galen Renaissance Aristotles ideas natural history medicine survived generally taken unquestioningly Ethics Aristotle considered ethics practical rather theoretical study ie one aimed good rather knowing sake He wrote several treatises ethics including notably Nichomachean Ethics Aristotle taught virtue proper function ergon thing An eye good eye much see proper function eye sight Aristotle reasoned humans must function specific humans function must activity psuch normally translated soul accordance reason logos Aristotle identified optimum activity soul aim human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated happiness sometimes well To potential ever happy way necessarily requires good character thik aret often translated moral ethical virtue excellence Aristotle taught achieve virtuous potentially happy character requires first stage fortune habituated deliberately teachers experience leading later stage one consciously chooses best things When best people come live life way practical wisdom phronsis intellect nous develop towards highest possible ethical virtue wisdom Politics In addition works ethics address individual Aristotle addressed city work titled Politics Aristotles conception city organic considered one first conceive city manner Aristotle considered city natural community Moreover considered city prior family turn prior individual ie last order becoming first order He also famous statement man nature political animal Aristotle conceived politics like organism rather like machine collection parts none exist without others It noted modern understanding political community state However state foreign Aristotle He referred political communities cities Aristotle understood city political partnership Subsequently city created avoid injustice economic stability rather live good life The political partnership must regarded therefore sake noble actions sake living together This distinguished social contract theory individuals leave state nature fear violent death inconveniences Rhetoric poetics Aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry music imitative varying imitation medium object manner For example music imitates media rhythm harmony whereas dance imitates rhythm alone poetry language The forms also differ object imitation Comedy instance dramatic imitation men worse average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better average Lastly forms differ manner imitation narrative character change change drama drama Aristotle believed imitation natural mankind constitutes one mankinds advantages animals While believed Aristotles Poetics comprised two books one comedy one tragedy portion focuses tragedy survived Aristotle taught tragedy composed six elements plotstructure character style spectacle lyric poetry The characters tragedy merely means driving story plot characters chief focus tragedy Tragedy imitation action arousing pity fear meant effect catharsis emotions Aristotle concludes Poetics discussion either superior epic tragic mimesis He suggests tragedy possesses attributes epic possibly possesses additional attributes spectacle music unified achieves aim mimesis shorter scope considered superior epic Aristotle keen systematic collector riddles folklore proverbs school special interest riddles Delphic Oracle studied fables Aesop Modern scholarship Modern scholarship reveals Aristotles lost works stray considerably characterization surviving Aristotelian corpus Whereas lost works appear originally written intent subsequent publication surviving works appear Rather surviving works mostly resemble lectures unintended publication The authenticity portion surviving works originally Aristotelian also today held suspect books duplicating summarizing authorship one book questioned another book considered unlikely Aristotles Some individual works within corpus including Constitution Athens regarded scholars products Aristotles school perhaps compiled direction supervision Others On Colors may produced Aristotles successors Lyceum eg Theophrastus Straton Still others acquired Aristotles name similarities doctrine content De Plantis possibly Nicolaus Damascus Other works corpus include medieval palmistries astrological magical texts whose connections Aristotle purely fanciful selfpromotional Loss works According distinction originates Aristotle writings divisible two groups exoteric esoteric Most scholars understood distinction works Aristotle intended public exoteric technical works esoteric intended narrower audience Aristotles students philosophers familiar jargon issues typical Platonic Aristotelian schools Another common assumption none exoteric works extant Aristotles extant writings esoteric kind Current knowledge exactly exoteric writings like scant
